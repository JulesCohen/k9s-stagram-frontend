## Reflection
 
This, with the backend was a month and a half long project built after I got my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree at the University Of Montreal, Canada.
I've learned so much from this project. It has helped practice a lot of React core concept, like state management or the component lifecycle.
I've spent hours and hours reading documentations. One of the main challenges I ran into was to make the real-time notifications work. But with some patience, it finally did. Also, finding a way to compress the images I'm uploading wasn't easy.
